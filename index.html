        Yang's contemporary art works mainly focused on non-proliferation and public welfare. He adopted nuanced elaborations with symbolic visual constructs. Some of his artworks were exhibited on social media as in the fragmentation of contemporary existences. He also experimented on incorporating scientific elements in his art on science and consciousness.<br/>

        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"
                    style="max-width: 80%">
          Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a
          German-born theoretical physicist. He developed the
          general theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of
          modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). Einstein's
          work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of
          science. Einstein is best known in popular culture for his
          mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc<sup>2</sup> (which
          has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation"). He
          received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his "services
          to theoretical physics", in particular his discovery of
          the law of the photoelectric effect, a pivotal step in the
          evolution of quantum theory.
